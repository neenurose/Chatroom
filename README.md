# Chatroom
Chatroom implemented in Python

My Student ID: 17312349

This chat server is implemented in python3 and is using the default libraries available.

It wont run in python 2.7 or other versions as some library names are renamed in python 3.

Only Chat_server.py needs to be run.

The start.sh runs the Chat_server.py file and starts the server. To run start.sh, port number should also be passed.
./start.sh portnumber
example ./start.sh 5000
